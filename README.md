Matplotlib Challenge - The Power of Plots

## Objective

Pymaceuticals Inc. is a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA which specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals.  It has begun screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma, a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, I have been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study.  In this study, 249 mice identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens.  Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.  The purpose of the study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.  

I have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.
